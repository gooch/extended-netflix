# Extended Netflix

<img src="https://github.com/jontonsoup4/extended-netflix/raw/master/screenshots/Example.jpg" alt="Example" width=200>

Chrome extension for adding extended browsing categories to Netflix. 
This extension adds a dropdown field containing a long list of all of
the major subgenres that Netflix usually hides. The dropdown also contains
a search field which filters genres to your liking. Included is also a list
of every category that has ever been offered on netflix (20,000+), but this
is a highly experimental configuration that has to be manually enabled. [View
